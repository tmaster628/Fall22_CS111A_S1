# CS111A Section 1
_CS111A Code Repository for Section 1 (Fall 2022)_

Welcome to CS111A! Throughout this quarter, I'll be making a few code repos for you to play around with. They contain some things that we'll review in class, as well as a few things that we won't (but that I'd recommend you look at on your own!)

To clone this repository, log into myth, navigate to where you want the project to live, and then type

`git clone https://github.com/tmaster628/CS111A_NewCAOrientation_Ex.git`

From there, `cd` into the repo and type `make`. Now the program should be ready to run by typing

`./runMain`
